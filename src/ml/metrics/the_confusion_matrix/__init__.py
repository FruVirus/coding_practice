Machine Learning Fundamentals: The Confusion Matrix
===================================================

In summary, a Confusion Matrix tells you what your machine learning algorithm did right
and what it did wrong.

The size of the confusion matrix is determined by the number of things we want to
predict. If we are trying to predict two things, the confusion matrix would be 2 x 2,
etc.

The predicted values are the rows and the ground-truth values are the columns.

For a n x n matrix, the diagonals are the True Positives.

For a 2 x 2 matrix, the bottom-left value is the number of False Negatives and the
top-right value is the number of False Positives.
