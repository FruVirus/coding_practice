How Does This Course Help in ML Interviews?
===========================================

Machine learning system design interviews
-----------------------------------------

In the ML system design interview portion, candidates are given open-ended machine
learning problems and are expected to build an end-to-end machine learning system to
solve that problem.

The candidates should consider the following approach:

    1. Build a deeper understanding of the problem. Problem---What, When, Who, How
    2. Understand system requirement. For example, latency, scale, etc.
    3. Identify metrics to measure the performance of the system.
    4. Envision end-to-end system architecture. Identify key components.
    5. Come up with training data generation strategy.
    6. Engineer meaningful features for the given ML task.
    7. Select best suited ML modeling technique (e.g., transfer learning, feature
extraction, model ensemble, etc.).
