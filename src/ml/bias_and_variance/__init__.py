Machine Learning Fundamentals: Bias and Variance
================================================

The inability for a machine learning method (like linear regression) to capture the true
relationship is called bias.

The difference in fits between the training dataset and the test dataset is a
consequence of variance. Technically, variance refers to the amount by which the
predictions would change if we fit the model to a different training dataset.

Low bias models perform well on seen data.
Low variance models generalize better to unseen data.

High bias models underfit the training data
High variance models overfit the training data.
