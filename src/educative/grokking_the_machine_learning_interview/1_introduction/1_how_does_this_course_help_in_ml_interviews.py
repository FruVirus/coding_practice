How Does This Course Help in ML Interviews?
===========================================

The rise of machine learning
----------------------------

Machine learning aims at solving a multitude of complex problems and has seen rapid
progress in several areas such as speech understanding, visual understanding, search
ranking, credit card fraud detection, and so on.

Machine learning system design interviews
-----------------------------------------

In the ML system design interview portion, candidates are given open-ended machine
learning problems and are expected to build an end-to-end machine learning system to
solve that problem.

In order to answer such questions, the candidates should consider the following
approach.

1. Build a deeper understanding of the problem. Problem---What, When, Who, How

2. Understand system requirement. For example, latency, scale, etc.

3. Identify metrics to measure the performance of the system.

4. Envision end-to-end system architecture. Identify key components.

5. Come up with training data generation strategy.

6. Engineer meaningful features for the given ML task.

7. Select best suited ML modeling technique (e.g., transfer learning,
feature extraction, model ensemble, etc.).
