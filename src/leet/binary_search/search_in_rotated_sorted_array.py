Search in Rotated Sorted Array
------------------------------

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot
index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is
[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For
example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index
of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
