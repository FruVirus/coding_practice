9 Medians and Order Statistics
==============================

The i-th order statistic of a set of n elements is the i-th smallest element. For
example, the minimum of a set of elements is the first order statistic (i = 1), and the
maximum is the n-th order statistic (i = n).

This chapter addresses the problem of selecting the i-th order statistic from a set of n
distinct numbers. We formally specify the selection problem as follows:

Input: A set A of n (distinct) numbers and an integer i, with 1 <= i <= n.

Output: The element x in A that is larger than exactly i - 1 other elements of A.

We can solve the selection problem in O(n * lg n) time, since we can sort the numbers
using heapsort or merge sort and then simply index the i-th element in the output array.
