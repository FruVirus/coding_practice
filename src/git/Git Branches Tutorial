1. Creating New Branches

git branch <new-branch-name>
git branch <new-branch-name> revision_number

2. Switching Branches

git checkout <other-branch>
git switch <other-branch>

3. Renaming Branches

git branch -m <new-name>
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>

4. Publishing Branches

git push origin <local-branch>

5. Tracking Branches

git branch --track feature/login origin/feature/login
git checkout --track origin/feature/login

6. Pulling + Pushing Branches

git pull
git push
git branch -v

7. Deleting Branches

git branch -d <branch-name>

(1) To rename a remote branch, first delete the remote branch

git push origin --delete <old-name>

(2) Then, simply push the new local branch with the correct name

git push origin <new-name>

8. Merging Branches

(1) Check out the branch that should receive the changes

git switch main

(2) Execute the "merge" command with the name of the branch that contains the desired changes

git merge feature/uploader

9. Rebasing Branches

(1) Check out the branch that should receive the changes

git switch feature/uploader

(2) Execute the "rebase" command with the name of the branch that contains the desired changes

git rebase main

10. Comparing Branches

(1) To show which commits are in the feature/uploader branch that are NOT in the main branch

git log main..feature/uploader

(2) To show which commits are in the local main branch that are NOT in the remote main branch

git log origin/main..main
