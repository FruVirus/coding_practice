Reorder List
------------

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L_0 --> L_1 --> ... --> L_(n - 1) --> L_n

Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L_0 --> L_n --> L_1 â†’ L_(n - 1) --> L_2 --> L_(n - 2) --> ...

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Intuition
---------

1. Get the midpoint of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Merge the first and second halves one element at a time.
