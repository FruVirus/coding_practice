16 Greedy Algorithms
====================

Like dynamic-programming algorithms, greedy algorithms typically apply to optimization
problems in which we make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution.
The idea of a greedy algorithm is to make each choice in a locally optimal manner. A
greedy approach provides an optimal solution for many problems much more quickly than
would a dynamic-programming approach. We cannot always easily tell whether a greedy
approach will be effective, however. In particular, greedy algorithms do not always
yield globally-optimal solutions.
