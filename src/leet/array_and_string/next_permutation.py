Next Permutation
----------------

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence
or linear order.

    - For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are considered permutations of arr:
[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater
permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are
sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next
permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If
such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible
order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

    - For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
    - Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
    - While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not
have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Intuition
---------

1. Find first non-increasing element starting from right (foo).
2. Find first element greater than foo starting from right (bar) and swap foo with bar.
3. Reverse elements after foo to end of list.

We need to find the next lexicographic permutation of the given list of numbers than the
number formed by the given array.

First, we observe that for any given sequence that is in descending order, no next
larger permutation is possible. For example, no next permutation is possible for the
following array:

    [9, 5, 4, 3, 1]

We need to find the first pair of two successive numbers a[i] and a[i−1], from the
right, which satisfy a[i] > a[i-1]. Now, no rearrangements to the right of a[i−1] can
create a larger permutation since that subarray consists of numbers in descending order.
Thus, we need to rearrange the numbers to the right of a[i-1] including itself.

Now, what kind of rearrangement will produce the next larger number? We want to create
the permutation just larger than the current one. Therefore, we need to replace the
number a[i−1] with the number which is just larger than itself among the numbers lying
to its right section, say a[j].

    [9, 5, 1, 4, 3] --> [9, 5, 3, 4, 1]

We swap the numbers a[i−1] and a[j]. We now have the correct number at index i−1. But
still the current permutation isn't the permutation that we are looking for. We need the
smallest permutation that can be formed by using the numbers only to the right of
a[i−1]. Therefore, we need to place those numbers in ascending order to get their
smallest permutation.

    [9, 5, 3, 4, 1] --> [9, 5, 3, 1, 4]

But, recall that while scanning the numbers from the right, we simply kept decrementing
the index until we found the pair a[i] and a[i−1] where, a[i] > a[i-1]. Thus, all
numbers to the right of a[i−1] were already sorted in descending order. Furthermore,
swapping a[i−1] and a[j] didn't change that order. Therefore, we simply need to reverse
the numbers following a[i−1] to get the next smallest lexicographic permutation.
