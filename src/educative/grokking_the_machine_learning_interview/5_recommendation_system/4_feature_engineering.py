Feature Engineering
===================

To start the feature engineering process, we will first identify the main actors in the
movie/show recommendation process:

    1. Logged-in user

    2. Movie/show

    3. Context (e.g., season, time, etc.)

User-based features
-------------------

    - age

    - gender

    - language

    - country

    - average_session_time

    - last_genre_watched

    - user_actor_histogram

    - user_genre_histogram

    - user_language_histogram

Context-based features
----------------------

    - season_of_the_year

    - upcoming_holiday

    - days_to_upcoming_holiday

    - time_of_day

    - day_of_week

    - device

Media-based features
--------------------

    - public-platform-rating

Media-user cross features
-------------------------

In order to learn the usersâ€™ preferences, representing their historical interactions
with media as features is very important. For instance, if a user watches a lot of
Christopher Nolan movies, that would give us a lot of information about what kind of
movies the user likes.

    - user_genre_historical_interaction_3months

    - user_genre_historical_interaction_1year

    - user_and_movie_embedding_similarity

    - user_actor

    - user_director

    - user_language_match

    - user_age_match

    - movie_id
