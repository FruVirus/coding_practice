System Design Basics
====================

Whenever we are designing a large system, we need to consider a few things:

1. What are the different architectural pieces that can be used?

2. How do these pieces work with each other?

3. How can we best utilize these pieces: what are the right tradeoffs?

Investing in scaling before it is needed is generally not a smart business proposition;
however, some forethought into the design can save valuable time and resources in the
future.
