Introduction
============

Numerical methods can be distinguished from other branches of analysis and computer
science by three characteristics:

1. They work with arbitrary real numbers (and vector spaces/extensions thereof): the
desired results are not restricted to integers or exact rationals (although in practice
we only ever compute rational approximations of irrational results).

2. Like in computer science (= math + time = math + money), we are concerned not only
with existence and correctness of the solutions (as in analysis), but with the time (and
other computational resources, e.g. memory) required to compute the result.

3. We are also concerned with accuracy of the results, because in practice we only ever
have approximate answers:
    a. Some algorithms may be intrinsically approximate—like the Newton’s Method for
calculating square roots---they converge towards the desired result but never reach it
in a finite number of steps. How fast they converge is a key question.
    b. Arithmetic with real numbers is approximate on a computer, because we approximate
the set R of real numbers by the set F of floating-point numbers, and the result of
every elementary operation (+,−,×,÷) is rounded to the nearest element of F. We need to
understand F and how accumulation of these rounding errors affects different algorithms
